# BabyBib
This is the [Freesewing](https://freesewing.org/) BabyBib pattern that is created in our
[pattern design tutorial](https://docs.freesewing.org/designer/tutorial/part-1).

We keep it here for reference. If you want to add this to your instance of [freesewing core](https://github.com/freesewing/core/),
you can add it as a Git submodule under `patterns/Docs/BabyBib`.

You can also add it under another namespace than `Docs` but in that case, you'll have to edit the 
pattern class to update the namespace declaration:

```
/** Freesewing\Patterns\YourNamespaceHere\BabyBib class */
namespace Freesewing\Patterns\YourNamespaceHere;
```
